# weather-dashboard

## Description

I developed a weather dashboard using the Open Weather Map API. I was able to fetch the data from Open Weather and manipulate it to pull the information needed to display. This is a handy tool for planning travel, outdoor activities, etc so you can determine if the weather will suit your needs. 

By developing all of the code from scratch, I was able to demonstrate what I have learned throughout the Carleton University Full Stack Coding Bootcamp as well as be resourceful to research bugs that come up along the way. I was also able to learn how to utilize API documentation to learn how to fetch and manipulate data from an outside source. 

## Installation

n/a

## Usage

You can visit [my deployed site here](https://mdeluca13.github.io/weather-dashboard/).

1. When you type a city's name into the search bar and click the search button, you are presented with the current weather and 5 day forecast of the searched city. 
2. If you are looking for a common named city, you can narrow down your search by using country code. For example, if you want to search for London in Canada, you can search London,CA. If you want to search for London in the United Kingdom, you can search London,UK.
3. When you search a city, it gets added to local storage, so if you want to search the previous city again, you can just click on that button.
